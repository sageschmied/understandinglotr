                    <p>Sauron. He’s big, he’s bad, he’s ugly. And not to mention the literal eye in the sky.  </p>

                    <p>But I bet you’ve wondered while watched the Lord of the Rings films, who is this dude? Where did he come from? How come he’s so bad and big? Well I may have some answers for you.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/300124-product-feature.jpg"></p>

                    <p>Sauron, is he a guy? Is he an elf? What the heck is he?? Sauron is actually of the race of Maia/Maiar, (and so are Balrogs by the way, you know, big fire dude- YOU SHALL NOT PASS!), but you can learn more about the Maiar/Maia in the post on races in LOTR. </p>

                    <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7d/27/40/7d2740a2cf19899f9828651482bf30cc.jpg"style="width:604px;height:548px;">
                    <p>Essentially, Sauron existed before the world which Middle Earth exists in was created. He’s very evil, and powerful, because of his race he can exist in any sort of form he wishes and can basically do major damage. Sauron though, learned everything he knew from the original bad boy- Melkor/Melko/Morgoth.  </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Melkor The Orignal Bad Guy</h2>

                    <p>Melkor/Melko/Morgoth was of the Valar, the higher up, more powerful versions of the Maiar, and were very active in the creating of the world. Melkor was known as “he who arises in might”, or Morgoth “the dark enemy of the world” and Sauron was his second in command basically.</p>

                    <p>This dude was even, bigger and meaner and uglier than Sauron and he did everything he could to screw up the world in the beginning.  Melkor was filled with anger, jealousy, arrogance etc. basically all the characteristics of an evil, evil dude.  </p>

                    <blockquote>"From splendour he fell through arrogance to contempt for all things save himself, a spirit wasteful and pitiless" Melkor, as described in The Simarillion p. 23</blockquote>

                    <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e5/d1/04/e5d1048feb1d1f2da6851d1fe27db5fd.jpg" style="width:504px;height:528px;">

             

                    <p>Melkor, fortunately met his demise and was literally kicked out of the world, never to be seen again in Middle Earth. Sauron however, managed to escape from the forces of good, and went on to terrorize the characters we know and love from the LOTR films</p>
                    
                    

                    <p>Sauron is also known as a “Gorthaur the Cruel,” and was there every step of the way and through every evil deed that Melkor did (And Melkor created Orcs y’all). In the end, Sauron rose like a shadow and followed Melkor’s  path down to the Void of the world. </p>

                    <p>Galadriel and Elrond, the two main elves in the Lord of the Rings Films, and seemingly more major than the films may make them out to be. I know as I have watched the movies, I have always wondered about the other elves and what was so important about Galadriel and Elrond themselves that they are basically singled out in the films. </p>

                    <p>Upon reading the literature of the history of Middle Earth, and taking the course, I learned that Galadriel and Elrond are really old. I mean really, really old. And if it was not clear in the movies, Galadriel has seniority as she is the older of the two</p>

                    <p>Galadriel is actually quite a bit older than Elrond. She was born before the world of Middle Earth even resembled what it does in the movies. And to give some idea of her age, without going into extreme detail about how time works in the Tolkien universe, The Lord of the Rings epic occurs in the end of the third age, and this can be seen from the Fellowship of the Ring starting sequence when it says the date. </p>

                    <p>Galadriel was born before the ages even happened and when the trees of Valinor were still around (Trust me this is a long time ago). From another perspective, her grandfather was one of the first to walk the world and was a leader of a group of elves known as the Noldor. Basically, Galadriel is really old, and a very important figure because of her family history, in a sense she is elf royalty.  </p>

                    <p> <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/c/cb/Galadriel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151015204512"style="width:304px;height:528px;" ></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Elrond</h2>

                    <p>Elrond on the other hand was born in the first age, so a lot sooner to the Lord of the Rings epic but still very old and he was around for some major events earlier in time, even if he was just a kid. His great great grandfather was the brother of Galadriel’s father. So yes, they are related and from the same ancestry and old bloodline of elves. </p>

                    <p>Interestingly, Elrond is not all elf, and his grandfather was of one of the first houses of men, however, due to an interesting and long story which will not be explained here, Elrond got to choose which fate he wanted, and he decided he wanted to have the fate of the elves, whereas his brother Elros chose the fate of men.  </p>

                    <blockquote></blockquote>

                    <p><img src= "http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/9/9f/Elrond_of_Rivendell.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130202120854"style="width:304px;height:528px;"></p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Their Relations</h2>

                    <p>However, it does get more complicated. Galadriel married an elf called Celeborn and they had a daughter Celebrian who Elrond married and had three children with including Arwen. That seems simple enough, however Elrond’s mother was the great grandchild of Elwe whose brother was Olwe, whose daughter was Earwen, who is Galadriel’s mother</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="" alt="">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted"></span>

                    <p> So they are sort of related in a few different ways. However, Elves nevermarry elves who are closely related to them, and there was obviously no concern with Elrond marrying Celebrian so who is to judge. </p>
                   <img src="https://masteroflore.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/elrond-tree.gif">
                    <p> On a side note, Elros, Elrond’s brother is the far back ancestor of Aragorn. So in a very distant, far far far away relation, Aragorn and Arwen are cousins. I think knowing where the Elves came from is actually really cool and knowing how they are related is nice, since the impression I get from the Lord of the Rings movies is that these people do not have much to do with each other and are completely different and unrelated from each other when really, they are not.  </p>

                    <p>When watching Lord of the Rings I have always accepted the fact that there were Elves, Men and Dwarves to name but a few of the races of Middle Earth. Anyways, I never really questioned it or thought to myself about the origins or differences (besides the obvious ones) of these races. </p>

                    <p>Now, having learned about the differences, I can not passively watch the movies without thinking about the origins and differences between them. </p>

                    <p>Not in the Films</p>

                    <h2 class="subsection-heading"> Valar </h2>

                    <p>The Valar are the highest beings to be found in the world, and had a part in creating it also. The are a higher form than the Maiar/Maia but are of a similar being. The Valar are not present in the films and therefore will not be talked a lot here, but to mention that the Maiar/Maia served them and had certain attributes depending on who they served (such is the way of Sauron and Melkor as discussed in the Origins of Evil post.) </p>
                    <img src="http://pre02.deviantart.net/8ac7/th/pre/f/2012/314/8/6/bm__the_valar_by_lelia-d5f0y62.jpg"style="width:404px;height:328px;">
                    <P> Represented in the Films <p>
                    <h2 class="subsection-heading"> Maiar/Maia</h2>

                    <p>As mentioned, the Maiar/Maia served the Valar and are of a lesser degree but are similar to them. They are also not of the world but they come to inhabit it just as the Valar do. As talked about some of the Maiar/Maia include Sauron and the Balrogs. Sauron was a servant of Aule before becoming a servant of Melkor, Aule is a Valar who is known as the “lord of all substances of the world,” his skills are with the creation of objects and things of the Earth. There are other individuals who we know from the Lord of the Rings films that are Maiar/Maia as well. The wizards are actually all Maiar/Maia and were sent by the Valar to help those in Middle Earth because of Sauron. They only existed on earth during the third age, and arrived about the year 1000 of the third age. Saruman (White Wizard) was also a servant of Aule (coincidence, I think not). While Gandalf was most likely a servant of Manwe the Valar who is enamored by air/clouds and is like a king figure among them.  </p>

                        <h2 class="subsection-heading"> Elves</h2>

                    <blockquote></blockquote>

                    <p>Elves were the first beings to awaken (in a place called Cuivienen)  and walk in Middle Earth and were created by Iluvatar (God) and from one of their many names are known as the first born. Elves can not die unless they are slain or the earth dies. Their age never shows and they are the fairest of all beings. They can also be reincarnated if killed and death is not necessarily the end for them unless they chose it to be so. Elves are fairer and wiser than men, and hold most of the knowledge of the world from the beginning as they kept it and also were around before men were. </p>
                    <img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/0/05/Elves_leaving_Middle-earth.png/revision/latest?cb=20130215125805"style="width:404px;height:328px;">
                    <h2 class="subsection-heading"> Men</h2>

                    <p>Men were the second beings to awaken (in a place called Hildorien), and are also known as the second born. Men are given the gift of seeking beyond the world, and their hearts have no rest wherein. They fashion their own lives and fate is not a master to their lives. Men do die and are not immortal like Elves, and it is unknown what happens to men once they die. It is worth mentioning that the first men however did resemble the elves more than they do in the Lord of the Rings films, in that they had very long lives, were very strong and had similar stature to the elves. </p>

                        <h2 class="subsection-heading"> Dwarves </h2> 
                    <p>Interestingly, dwarves are not from the same creation of elves and men. Dwarves actually were not created by Iluvatar (god) but were created by Aule, the Valar who likes to make and build things. Aule was so impatient about the coming of Elves and Men to the world, as the Valar knew they were coming and were mostly on earth because of this reason, that he decided to make his own people so that he could teach and interact with them. So Aule created dwarves, he had no idea what elves and men were going to look like, hence why dwarves look so different from elves and men, and why dwarves have a completely different language from elves and men. Aule’s impatience however did lead to a lot of trouble not only with Iluvatar but also with his wife, Yavanna who cursed the dwarves to never love any living thing, and to only love that which they make with their own hands, which explains why they love mining, gems and metal so much.  </p>

                    <p>Does everyone know how in the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring there is that whole sequence about how there is all these rings of power given to all the races, except turns out there is one ultimate ring of power that Sauron has? I’m sure you know what I am talking about, and I am sure you are all curious as to what the heck the rings of power are as much as I was when watching the films. Who even made them? What is their purpose?</p>

                    <p>I never really thought this was clear in the movies so here is what I have learned that I think paints a better picture of these very important objects which the films center on.</p>

                    <p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/lAHqtnz.jpg"></p>

                    <p>All the rings were created (nineteen of which) were created by the elves and sixteen of which Sauron had a hand in making. Sauron intended the use of the rings to remain in elven hands and be used so that he could control them using the one ring over these other rings. </p>

                    <p>However, once the wearers of the rings put their rings on they were aware of Sauron’s plot and threw the rings of in disgust. This led to an open war in which Sauron gained the sixteen rings back from the elves, while the elves fled with three of them and kept them safe from Sauron. </p>

                    <p>The three rings that were kept from Sauron were the most powerful and important and were made without his knowledge. They were forged by Celebrimbor himself, on of the Noldor and great skill. These three rings are Narya, Nenya and Vilya, the rings of fire, water and air.</p>

                    <p>Sauron wished very much to possess these rings, however they went to the three elven kings, and during the time of the Lord of the Rings story were worn by Gandalf, Galadriel and Elrond respectively (another reason why those elves are so important).  </p>

                    <p>From the movie, we all know that the rings that Sauron managed to take were given to the dwarven lords and the kings of men. Seven were given to the dwarves and nine to the kings of men, these rings made the wearers all fall to some form of doom. For the dwarves, although not convinced by Sauron like men, greed and lust for wealth overtook them and led to their destruction. Whereas, the men as we all know were corrupted by Sauron and became the Nazgul or Ringwraiths. </p>

                    <p>Clearly, there is a lot more to these rings then just a piece of jewellery. </p>
